<ul class="FAQ">
<li><div class="question">Q: After having installed GNU Privacy Guard, I have the following error when invoking it on the command-line:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>gpg</span>
gpg: /Users/joe/.gnupg/secring.gpg: can't create keyring: Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `/Users/joe/.gnupg/secring.gpg': file open error
gpg: /Users/joe/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: can't create keyring: Permission denied
gpg: keyblock resource `/Users/joe/.gnupg/pubring.gpg': file open error
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
</code></div>
<div class="answer">A: You probably copied your keyrings from MacOS 9, and didn't take care of file permissions. Open the Terminal and type the following:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>sudo chown -R $LOGNAME $HOME/.gnupg
<span class="prompt">&gt; </span>chmod 600 $HOME/.gnupg/*</span>
</code></div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: After having exported my MacOS 9 keyrings (in ASCII), <span class="executable">gpg</span> is unable to import them.</div>
<div class="answer">A: End-of-line characters are different on MacOS 9 and MacOS X. Execute the following command in the Terminal to correct the problem:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>tr -d '\r' &lt; myMacOS9ExportedKeyring &gt; myMacOSXImportableKeyring</span>
</code></div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: GPGMail is unable to find <span class="executable">gpg</span>, which has been installed via <span class="executable">fink</span>. How can I make it aware that <span class="executable">gpg</span> is in another location?</div>
<div class="answer">A: GPGMail expects <span class="executable">gpg</span> to be located in <span class="path">/usr/local/bin/</span>, like do other GnuPG-related applications. Either move it there, or make a soft link. <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences</a> will do it for you.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I can't open any new compose windows, or reply to any message. Mail doesn't do anything or crashes each time.</div>
<div class="answer">A: There is a problem with toolbar items added by GPGMail, on some occasions. To correct the problem, quit Mail, launch Terminal and type:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults delete com.apple.mail "NSToolbar Configuration ComposeNewOrDraft"
<span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults delete com.apple.mail "NSToolbar Configuration ComposeReplyOrForward"
<span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults delete com.apple.mail "NSToolbar Configuration MessageViewer"
<span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults delete com.apple.mail "NSToolbar Configuration TornOffViewer"</span>
</code></div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I can't send an encrypted message to my friend, despite I have her public key, with the corresponding email address.</div>
<div class="answer">A: Check that the public key has been signed by your key. You can sign a key locally like this:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>gpg --lsign-key myFriendKeyID</span>
</code>
Read <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html">GnuPG documentation</a> to know more about signing keys. Note that this problem will not happen if you use <span class="executable">gpg</span> 1.0.7: GPGMail forces <span class="executable">gpg</span> to accept unsigned keys, by default.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I work in an environment where my home folder is on a 
network, so the folder <span class="path">~/.gnupg</span> is implicitly insecure.  It would be 
great if there were an easy way to specify <span class="option">--homedir 
/Volumes/LocalSecureDisk/GPGStuff</span> for instance in a preference field.</div>
<div class="answer">A: There are two ways to do this currently: the first solution would be to write a shell script which would invoke <span class="executable">gpg</span> with the <span class="option">--homedir</span> argument, and tell GPGMail to use this script instead of <span class="executable">gpg</span>. The second solution is to set the environment variable <span class="variable">GNUPGHOME</span>: create or modify the file <span class="path">$HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist</span> with <span class="path">/Developer/Applications/PropertyListEditor</span> and add a new key-value entry named <span class="variable">GNUPGHOME</span>; you need to log out and log in again for this change to apply. Note that you can also use <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences</a> for this.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I guess I installed GPGMail correctly, but the buttons don't appear in the toolbar. What's wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: GPGMail buttons don't appear (yet) magically in Mail toolbars; you need to customize the different toolbars to add the buttons <b>Encrypt</b> and <b>Sign</b>, or <b>Decrypt</b> and <b>Authenticate</b>. There are in fact four different toolbars, and each one must be customized independantly. Note that buttons are now quite useless, since GPGMail 1.0.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I installed GPGMail correctly, but the buttons don't appear in the toolbar, and there is no menu, however I executed the command 
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool true</span>
</code>
What's wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You probably executed the command as user root, didn't you?! Each user wanting to use GPGMail must execute the command with her own account, not root's. BTW, you should never work as user root!</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I use now GnuPG 1.0.7, and I can no longer encrypt any message. I always get the message
<code class="terminal">1234ABCD: There is no indication that this key really belongs to the owner
no valid addressees
[stdin]: sign+encrypt failed: no such user id
</code>What's wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: Starting with GnuPG 1.0.7, keys always need to be signed by their owner. You're probably trying to use a public key which has not been signed by its owner.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I am trying to use the GPGMail plugin, but I keep getting this cryptic error.
<code class="terminal">skipped `myname@mac.com': duplicated
</code>What does this mean and how do I fix it?</div>
<div class="answer">A: GPGMail automatically includes your own public key (i.e. the one define in GPGMail preferences) when encrypting. You asked explicitely GPGMail to use that key again by putting your email address in the To: or CC: fields. Just remove it.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: When I reply to an encrypted message, the reply quotes the encrypted message, not the decrypted message that I'm reading. How can I force Mail to use the decrypted message?</div>
<div class="answer">A: GPGMail does not allow you to do this automatically. To workaround the problem, select the decrypted content before clicking the <b>Reply</b> button.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: How can I uninstall GPGMail?</div>
<div class="answer">A: To uninstall GPGMail, you only need to delete the file <span class="path">GPGMail.mailbundle</span> located in <span class="path">$HOME/Library/Mail/Bundles</span>.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: How can I tell GPGMail to automatically retrieve public keys needed when encrypting or verifying a message?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You can configure <span class="executable">gpg</span> to automatically retrieve keys when verifying messages. Modify file <span class="path">$HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf</span> (or use <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences</a>) with TextEdit and add the following lines:
<code class="terminal">keyserver x-hkp://wwwkeys.us.pgp.net
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-disabled include-revoked
</code></div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: How can I participate to your beta testing program?</div>
<div class="answer">A: Subscribe to GPGMail's mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:gpgmail-users-on@sente.ch">gpgmail-users-on@sente.ch</a>. This is a very low traffic mailing list that I use to give information about the development of GPGMail. Archives are accessible on-line at <a href="http://www.sente.ch/Lists/gpgmail-users/List.html">http://www.sente.ch/Lists/gpgmail-users/List.html</a>.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I'm exchanging encrypted emails with a friend who uses Ximian Evolution, and his mailer doesn't recognize the mails I send. My friend needs to copy-paste the contents of the email to the Terminal to be able to decrypt it. Why?</div>
<div class="answer">A: Ximian Evolution recognizes only the new MIME format for PGP emails, whereas GPGMail recognizes both old (inline) and new (MIME) formats. By defaults, GPGMail uses the old format if your mail is plain text only (no rich text attributes, no attachment). If you want GPGMail to always use the new format, go to GPGMail preferences and select the option <b>By default, use OpenPGP-MIME</b> in the <b>Composing</b> tab. You can change that option on a per message basis by selecting menu <b>Message</b>/<b>PGP</b>/<b>Force Use of PGP-MIME</b>.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I cannot install GPGMail, because when I type in the Terminal the following command I get an error:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>default write com.apple.mail EnableBundles YES</span>
default: Too many arguments.
</code></div>
<div class="answer">A: You need to have the BSD subsystem package installed. It is provided by MacOS X installation CD. You'd better use GPGMail installer provided with GPGMail distribution. BTW you typed <span class="executable">default</span> instead of <span class="executable">defaults</span>, which is a different Unix command.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: Can I install both GPGMail and PGP8?</div>
<div class="answer">A: No. Both plug-ins try to do the same job in the same way (PGPmail is based on GPGMail - have a look at PGP8 credits to verify this) and this will create conflicts; sometimes Mail will crash, or GPGMail will simply not work. If you plan to use one of the plug-ins, remove the other one. GPGMail is installed in the folder <span class="path">Library/Mail/Bundles</span> of your home folder, whereas PGPmail is installed in <span class="path">/Library/Mail/Bundles</span>. Since GPGMail 1.0, an alert panel will be displayed if GPGMail sees that PGPmail has been loaded too.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I have installed GPGMail and all its functions, buttons, etc. show
up in Mail, but no matter what - whenever I send a message - it is sent
unencrypted and/or unsigned. I have tried the toolbar buttons, the menu
selections, etc. and still no encrypted output. Am I doing something
obviously wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You previously installed PGPmail.mailbundle and need to remove it. Both PGPmail and GPGMail plug-ins try to do the same job in the same way (PGPmail is based on GPGMail - have a look at PGP8 credits to verify this) and this will create conflicts; sometimes Mail will crash, or GPGMail will simply not work. If you plan to use one of the plug-ins, remove the other one. GPGMail is installed in the folder <span class="path">Library/Mail/Bundles</span> of your home folder, whereas PGPmail is installed in <span class="path">/Library/Mail/Bundles</span>. Since GPGMail 1.0, an alert panel will be displayed if GPGMail sees that PGPmail has been loaded too.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I've just changed my passphrase in gnupg with french accentuated text (&eacute;, &agrave;, ...) and now I can't signed my messages. Is there any way to enable accentuated text? Maybe by editing the sourcecode?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You probably used the wrong string encoding in Terminal when changing your passphrase. GPGMail uses UTF-8 string encoding when passing passphrase to <span class="executable">gpg</span>.<br />
You should go back to Terminal, change your passphrase to contain no accent, THEN set the Terminal to use UTF-8 string encoding (use <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">GPGPreferences</a>, it's easier), and then you can set back your passphrase with accents.<br />
Note that it's generally not a good idea to use accents in passphrases, for that reason.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I don't understand your FAQ! You're talking about <span class="variable">$HOME</span> or <span class="path">~</span>. What does this mean??</div>
<div class="answer">A: They both have the same meaning, in Unix terminology. They represent your home folder. You can use either <span class="variable">$HOME</span> or <span class="path">~</span> in shell scripts to tell the shell that you want the path to your home folder.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I think I found a bug in GPGMail. Whom should I contact?</div>
<div class="answer">A: Please send an email to <a href="mailto:gpgmail@sente.ch">gpgmail@sente.ch</a>. I need the following information:<ul>
<li>Which version of GPGMail do you use (see GPGMail's Finder info)?</li>
<li>Which MacOS X version do you use?</li>
<li>Which other Mail plug-ins are installed, if any (name + version)?</li>
<li>Do you have a crash report to submit (look if you have files named <span class="path">Mail.crash.log</span> or <span class="path">GPGMEProxyServer.crash.log</span> in <span class="path">$HOME/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/</span>)?</li>
<li>Are there any lines in the System console (see <span class="path">/Applications/Utilities/Console</span>) concerning Mail or GPGMail?</li>
</ul>
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I installed GPGMail, and everything's working correctly (encrypting, decrypting, signing, verifying), except that I can't access GPGMail preferences: in Mail preferences panel there is no PGP section. What can I do?</div>
<div class="answer">A: For some unknown reason Mail's preferences toolbar configuration is hardcoded in your preferences, and refuses to open PGP preferences; this happened very rarely. You need to quit Mail, launch Terminal and type:
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>defaults delete com.apple.mail "NSToolbar Configuration NSPreferences"</span>
</code></div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: Can I use GPGMail if the person I am mailing to is on a PC using Outlook or some such mail app not an Apple?</div>
<div class="answer">A: Yes, as long as your friend's mailer recognizes PGP signed/encrypted messages. There are plug-ins for Outlook on PC, as well as for other mailers, that do the same job as GPGMail for Mail.
<br />
The problem you might encounter is that some plug-ins don't support the 2 message formats used for PGP: they usually only support the old format, where you see the PGP armor (e.g. <code>----- PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -----</code>) in the body of the message, and the new format which uses MIME encapsulation and attachments, and which is far more robust than the old one (both formats are equally safe, when talking about encryption/electronic signature, but the content in the former format sometimes is modified by mailers/mail relays and is broken at arrival).
<br />
GPGMail partly supports the ASCII-armored format: it uses that format by default, as long as your message doesn't contain any attachment or style formatting. As soon as your message is no longer plain text, GPGMail uses the PGP-MIME format, which is not recognized by some mailers. You can force GPGMail to always use the PGP-MIME format, by changing its preferences, but you cannot force it to always use the former format.
<br />
GPGMail fails to decrypt/verify some messages which are not fully encrypted/signed, i.e. only a small part is encrypted/signed. That's a limitation.
<br />
You need to exchange your public PGP keys and start writing PGP-signed/encrypted messages, and see how well all formats are supported.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I've got multiple uids in my public key, but when I send mail, the only one that gets used is the primary key (the other is greyed out in the signature pull-down.  Is there a way to enable GPGMail to use all uids?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You sign with a key, which happens to have multiple uids, but all these uids belong to the same key. You've published your public key, with all its uids, and people verifying your messages will see that it has been signed with your key (not your uid), and that that key has multiple uids.
<br />
Only the main uid is selectable in GPGMail (as well as all other PGP-related apps): it represents the key. Other uids on the key are just displayed for information, but are never selectable.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I have multiple PGP keys having the same email address, and one of these keys is expired. GPGMail always tell me that I can't use any PGP key for that email address, though there are valid keys. What can I do?</div>
<div class="answer">A: GPGMail will pick up the first key matching the email address, without searching for additional keys which would be valid. In order to change the order of keys during search, as a workaround, you should export the invalid keys, remove them from your keyring, and reimport them; read <span class="executable">gpg</span> documentation for that, or use <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/fr/">GPG Keychain Access</a>.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: Though the messages I receive are traditional inline PGP-signed ones, they are displayed with a MIME attachment. I don't understand why.</div>
<div class="answer">A: Maybe you're one of the few user using <span class="executable">procmail</span> rules, and one of the rules rewrites PGP messages, e.g. to ensure recognition by <span class="executable">mutt</span>. Check your <span class="executable">.procmail</span> file.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I tried to print a decrypted message, but I failed to: Mail printed the encrypted version of the message. How can I print the decrypted message?</div>
<div class="answer">A: There are some problems with decrypted messages, sometimes they re-encrypt themselves after some operations (opening in a new window, using key arrows, ...). Anyway, there is a way to print a decrypted message: you need to open the encrypted message in a new window (by double-clicking the encrypted message), then you decrypt it, and you can print the decrypted message.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: My friend's using <span class="executable">mutt</span> as mail agent, but he says <span class="executable">mutt</span> can't decrypt the messages I send him, though they seem valid. What's wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: <span class="executable">mutt</span> recognizes OpenPGP-MIME format, but doesn't recognize old-style (inline) PGP messages; if your friend uses <span class="executable">procmail</span>, then he can add the following rule in his <span class="path">.muttrc</span> file:
<code class="terminal">message-hook '!(~g|~G|~b"Comment:\ Debian\ ::\ The\ Universal\ Operating\ System") ~b"^-+BEGIN\ PGP\ (SIGNED\ )?MESSAGE"' "exec check-traditional-pgp"
</code>
(see <a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/unix/mutt/publish/gpg">http://blue.frogfoot.net/unix/mutt/publish/gpg</a> for more information)
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: Mail crashes when launched; if I remove the following libraries, <span class="executable">libgpgme-pthread</span> and <span class="executable">libgpg-error</span>,  from <span class="path">/usr/local/lib/</span>, Mail works again.</div>
<div class="answer">A: Unfortunately GPGMail will try to load these librairies from <span class="path">/usr/local/lib/</span> before trying the embededd ones, and if the versions in <span class="path">/usr/local/lib/</span> are older then the embedded ones, Mail will crash; you need to remove these libraries from <span class="path">/usr/local/lib/</span>, until a new version of GPGMail fixes that unwanted dependency.</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I have installed GPGMail and all its functions, buttons, etc. show
up in Mail, but no matter what - whenever I send a message - it is sent
unencrypted and/or unsigned. I have tried the toolbar buttons, the menu
selections, etc. and still no encrypted output. Am I doing something
obviously wrong?</div>
<div class="answer">A: If you have OD4Contact Mail bundle installed, then this bundle prevents GPGMail from working correctly. This problem has been reported to OD4Contact authors as of Feb 19th, and there is no workaround for the moment except uninstalling OD4Contact Mail bundle: remove file ODMailBundle.mailbundle from the folder <span class="path">Library/Mail/Bundles</span> in your home directory. The problem has been noticed with OD4Contact version 2.6.4.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: I have <span class="executable">gpg</span> installed in another location than <span class="path">/usr/local/bin/</span>. How can I make GPGMail work with it?</div>
<div class="answer">A: You need to create soft links to <span class="executable">gpg</span> and its helper executables. E.g.
<code class="terminal"><span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/</span>
<span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>cd /usr/local/bin/</span>
<span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>ln -s /opt/local/bin/gpg</span>
<span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/libexec/</span>
<span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>cd /usr/local/libexec</span>
<span class="input"><span class="prompt">&gt; </span>ln -s /opt/local/libexec/gnupg</span>
</code></div></li>

<li><a name="unread" /><div class="question">Q: Since I installed GPGMail, some read messages have their 'read' status come back to 'unread'. What's happening?</div>
<div class="answer">A: It's is a bug in GPGMail that I've been unable to fix yet. The only workaround that works for most people (but not all) is to disable automatic decryption/verification of emails.
</div></li>

<li><div class="question">Q: GPGMail blocks Mail when verifying messages. Why</div>
<div class="answer">A: When performing message verification, <span class="executable">gpg</span> searches for missing PGP keys. Depending on which key server you use, this can take a long time. You can either disable the automatic key retrieval, change the key server, or change the timeout for searching keys. See <a href="x-man-page://1/gpg">gpg man page</a>.
